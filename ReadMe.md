Description:
FlakesEngine is a simplified Engine for Java 2.5D games like Zelda, Harvestmood & Pokémon..!
I started to write this javaApp because I couldn't find a satisfying 2.5D GameEngine That was free.
Its not Simple as RPGmaker or anything like that, but its more advanced and you also have
My permission to build it out and use it at a base for another engine/game.

Greats
